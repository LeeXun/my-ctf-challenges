## Balsn CTF 2019

- Solved Ratio: 5/720

### Solution

0. Well, I spent lots of time on building the beautiful frontend page. Hope you like it :)
1. In [go.mod](balsn-ctf-2019/gopher-party/go.mod) which can discover this is go1.13. But go scheduler was [released in go1.1](http://morsmachine.dk/go-scheduler) so this won't be a problem.
3. Looking into [main.go](balsn-ctf-2019/gopher-party/main.go), which can find my hint about setting `runtime.GOMAXPROCS(1)` and `t2.nano`.
4. Global search "flag" and ignore the vendors, you may find there's only one target in [register.go]((balsn-ctf-2019/gopher-party/controller/register.go).
5. Simple as it said: you should be the chosen to get the flag.
6. However, after looking for where the sp is defined in [store/store.go](balsn-ctf-2019/gopher-party/store/store.go). You can discover that there's a goroutine keeps changing `the chosen` in every 2ms. 
7. Now the goal is simple: <b>try not to be preempted by other goroutines</b>.
7. This is a challenge of how to avoid racing by the goroutine and other participants' requests!
8. Actually, goroutine will not be preemted by others. Instead, <b>it 'yields' itself and switches context to other goroutines in a magic function which is injected by go compiler: morestack().</b> About the details of how it works, [please check my slides](https://github.com/LeeXun/slides).
9. <b>In conclusion:</b>
    1. Don't let unbuffered channels get blocked.
    1. Avoid making any RPC, like redis or google api. Which will cause netpolling.
    1. Avoid accidentally making the stack size of goroutine being too large.
    1. Avoid sleeping.
10. And there's one more thing that most of participants missed, <b>don't make the running time of your goroutine exceed 10ms</b>.
11. There's a sysmon which is running on a different OS thread then user goroutines. Which means, even if you avoid all the conditions above, OS may still swap you out and let sysmon set a magic value (0xfffffade) to your goroutine's stack edge address. When the next time your goroutine is up, it will be cheated that it's stack size is not enough. Then it will yield to next goroutine to execute on it's OS thread in the morestack function. As a result, this goroutine won't be the chosen one.
12. Which means you should find a language string in Accept-Language format that won't take too long in sha256 to complete the payload.
13. Even though this is not a RCE exploit, most of the golang writers who don't REALLY understand how goroutine works, will easily encounter some unexpected issues and finally cause system impairment. ^(Owo)-o _(XoX)rz

### Questions

1. Why can I get the flag when I am running the code at my local machine?
    - The connection between your golang server and redis is too fast. This is a trap.

### Payload

```bash
# Google account name is name1
TOKEN="access_token"
HOST="http://localhost:8000/register"

function poc()
{
  curl "${HOST}" \
  -H 'accept-language: hu' \
  -H 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data "name=different_from_name1&access_token=${TOKEN}&interest=AH!&age=-1&praise=&prove="
}

poc
```
